              Depending on your share of the overall HBAR contribution, we allocate a proportional
              amount of the 20,000,000 HELI to your position. You can see the overall amount on the
              vesting page throughout the entire week.

            <li className="text-small">
              We then take the HBAR and HELI and turn them into an LP token that will be used on the
              HBAR/ HELI pool to bootstrap liquidity.

            <li className="text-small">
              Over the next 3 months, your LP tokens will vest linearly and you can retrieve them on
              the same page as you originally deposited your HBAR. The amount of LP tokens you will
              receive will be directly proportional to the amount of HBAR you have contributed in
              relation to the total amount of HBAR contributed.
